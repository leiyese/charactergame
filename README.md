# Hero Battle Game

A text-based battle game where the player controls a hero, encounters enemies, fights them, and tries to survive while managing health, weapons, and actions. This project is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python.

## Features

- Control a customizable **hero** with health and weapons.
- Encounter random **enemies** from a predefined list.
- Perform actions like **attack**, **defend**, and **equip** different weapons.
- Save battle results to a file (`save_data.txt`).
- Simple menu-based interaction.

## How to Play

1. Choose an action from the main menu:
   - **Fight an enemy**: Engage in a battle with a randomly selected enemy.
   - **Rest**: Recover your health to maximum.
   - **Return home**: Exit the game.

2. During battles, you can:
   - **Attack**: Attack the enemy with your currently equipped weapon.
   - **Defend**: Defend yourself to mitigate enemy damage.
   - **Equip a weapon**: Choose a new weapon from your inventory to equip during the fight.

3. Defeat enemies and try to survive. If your health reaches zero, the game will end.
